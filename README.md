# Contributing
NyaaRequest was made out of boredom and the need to learn python. I was tired of learning through tutorials so i thought that doing projects would be the best way. So contributing is very helpful for me to learn good python practices. 

**Any kind of contributions, from issues to PRs, help. Thank you.**
